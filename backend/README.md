# Development Setup:

- If you have already mongodb installed on your system, run it. \
 OR
- Run mongodb inside docker (Compose file is written here [docker](docker/mongodb/docker-compose.yml)):
  - cd docker/mongodb
  - docker-compose up

Once Mongodb is up:

- cd into root directory with `cd ../..`
- Install packages with `npm install`
- Start development with `npm run start:dev`

# Recommendations:

- Use Postman for checking the api requests
- Use Robo3T tool as a mongodb gui
